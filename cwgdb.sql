(1, 'Text1', 'a', 'At most sites, a machine pass strongly affected topsoil properties with air filled porosity and air permeability being significantly decreased. The subsoil showed no changes or only minor signs of compaction. Only at the deeply fissured site, air filled porosity and air permeability were significantly reduced in the subsoil while bulk density was increased. The results show that a single pass with present-day heavy agricultural equipment does not necessarily lead to severe subsoil compaction. However, deeply fissured soils with an unstable subsoil structure are in serious danger of becoming severely recompacted. Nevertheless, the investigation does not reveal information on cumulative compactive effects of repeated passes with heavy machines as conducted on fields headlands, during the crop rotation or several rotational sequences. These potential negative impacts have to be regarded carefully and are investigated at present.', 1),
(2, 'Text2', 'b', 'Cognition includes the acquisition, processing, retention of, and acting upon information from the environment. Avian cognition has been investigated by the approaches of experimental psychology and in the context of specific tasks, such as spatial memory. However, the costs and benefits of cognitive ability have not been considered in a life-history context. I explore possible relationships between behaviors that might indicate cognitive function and other attributes, particularly brain size, rate of development, age at maturity, and life span. Large brain size and prolonged development are seen as potential costs of intelligent behavior. Long life span may permit the extended learning periods that support experienced-based cognitive function. Play behavior. which plausibly supports the development of motor and social skills, and, to a lesser extent, foraging innovations. are related to brain size. The challenge of foraging in a spatially and temporally varying environment, experienced for example by pelagic seabirds, is associated with prolonged embryonic development. Although these connections lack mechanistic foundations, they suggest that cognition can be considered as a part of the life history of the individual and that potential costs of cognition might provide guidelines for directing the comparative study of intelligent behavior.', 1),
(3, 'Text3', 'c', 'Surgery on the meniscus of the knee joint is one of the most frequently performed operations. The arthroscopic technique currently represents the general treatment standard and except in a few cases has completely superseded the open approach. Arthroscopy facilitates precise diagnosis and classification of all forms of meniscus lesions. In many cases even today partial resection on irreparably damaged meniscus tissue cannot be avoided. The goal is to preserve as much healthy meniscus tissue as possible. Types of tears amenable to reconstruction always require arthroscopic refixation. Various techniques are possible which have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the site of the lesion. In comparison to conventional techniques, in many cases modern implants and instruments make meniscus reconstruction easier entailing less morbidity. Substitution of lost meniscus tissue is possible with allograft transplantation; good results are possible especially on the lateral meniscus. A novel alternative is arthroscopic implantation of a biodegradable collagen matrix, which replaces partial defects on the medial meniscus. Long-term results of this treatment form must be awaited.', 1),
(4, 'Text4', 'd', 'Cell protrusions are outward extensions of the plasma membrane of individual cells that function in sensing the cell environment and in making initial, dynamic adhesions to extracellular matrix and other cells. Cell protrusions can be grouped into two major categories on the basis of morphology: localized, finger-like structures of highly defined shape and various lengths; or broad, irregular extensions of the plasma membrane. A key requirement of all cell protrusions is the need for a rigid cytoskeleton to support the localized extension of the plasma membrane. This is achieved either by a core unipolar bundle of actin microfilaments in finger-like protrusions, or by a combination of radial, rib-like, actin bundles integrated with a dendritic meshwork of microfilaments in the broad, lamellipodial protrusions. From studies of multiple cell types in vertebrates and invertebrates, fascin-1 has emerged as an actin-bundling protein of general importance for a diverse set of cell protrusions with functions in cell adhesion, cell interactions, and cell migration. This review discusses current knowledge of the molecular and cellular properties and functions of fascin, the roles of fascin-based protrusions in the cardiovascular system in health and disease, and areas of future interest.', 1),
(5, 'Text5', 'e', 'Subareas throughout a city may be viewed as both daytime destinations for some persons as well as residence (or nighttime) locations for some households. Associated with the average household in each subarea is the distribution of its members by their daytime destinations. Travel allocation of individuals by their principal subarea of daytime destination can be thus constructed for the average household in each subarea throughout a city. Intrahousehold allocation of daytime destinations can thus be represented in a convenient tabular form, the household composition matrix. Further interpretation shows the household composition matrix to be a special case of an origin-destination (O-D) matrix representing commuter volumes between subareas of nighttime and daytime location. Formal features of the household composition matrix, furthermore, render it equivalent to the Leontief input-output-matrix. The relationship between intrahousehold travel allocation and household composition. as an O-D matrix, emerges to be of particular importance within the context of Leontief''s input-output concept. Application to the Seoul Metropolitan Area indicates a discernable pattern in intrahousehold travel allocation when ordering of the household composition matrix is based on ratios between daytime and nighttime populations across the city''s subareas.', 1),
(6, 'Text6', 'f', 'The physical sources of randomness in quasibrittle fracture described by the cohesive crack model are discussed and theoretical arguments for the basic form of the probability distribution are presented. The probability distribution of the size effect on the nominal strength of structures made of heterogeneous quasibrittle materials is derived, under certain simplifying assumptions, from the nonlocal generalization of Weibull theory. Attention is limited to structures of positive geometry failing at the initiation of macroscopic crack growth from a zone of distributed cracking. It is shown that, for small structures, which do not dwarf the fracture process zone (FPZ), the mean size effect is deterministic, agreeing with the energetic size effect theory, which describes the size effect due to stress redistribution and the associated energy release caused by finite size of the FPZ formed before failure. Material randomness governs the statistical distribution of the nominal strength of structure and, for very large structure sizes, also the mean. The large-size and small-size asymptotic properties of size effect are determined, and the reasons for the existence of intermediate asymptotics are pointed out. Asymptotic matching is then used to obtain an approximate closed-form analytical expression for the probability distribution of failure load for any structure size. For large sizes, the probability distribution converges to the Weibull distribution for the weakest link model, and for small sizes, it converges to the Gaussian distribution justified by Daniels'' fiber bundle model. Comparisons with experimental data on the size-dependence of the modulus of rupture of concrete and laminates are shown. Monte Carlo simulations with finite elements are the subject of ongoing studies by Pang at Northwestern University to be reported later.', 1),
(7, 'Text7', 'g', 'The trace over the degrees of freedom located in a subset of the space transforms the vacuum state into a mixed density matrix with nonzero entropy. This is usually called entanglement entropy, and it is known to be divergent in quantum field theory (QFT). However, it is possible to define a finite quantity F(A, B) for two given different subsets A and B which measures the degree of entanglement between their respective degrees of freedom. We show that the function F (A, B) is severely constrained by the Poincare symmetry and the mathematical properties of the entropy. In particular, for one component sets in two-dimensional conformal field theories its general form is completely determined. Moreover, it allows to prove an alternative entropic version of the c-theorem for (1 + 1)-dimensional QFT. We propose this well-defined quantity as the meaningfull entanglement entropy and comment on possible applications in QFT and the black hole evaporation problem.', 1),
(8, 'Text8', 'h', 'We describe variable markov models we have used for statistical learning of musical sequences, then we present the factor oracle, a data structure proposed by Crochemore & al for string matching. We show the relation between this structure and the previous models and indicate how it can be adapted for learning musical sequences and generating improvisations in a real-time context.', 1),
(9, 'Text9', 'i', 'In this paper we study the external memory planar point enclosure\n\nproblem: Given N axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, construct a\n\ndata structure on disk (an index) such that all K rectangles\n\ncontaining a query point can be reported I/O-efficiently. This\n\nproblem has important applications in e.g. spatial and temporal\n\ndatabases, and is dual to the important and well-studied orthogonal\n\nrange searching problem. Surprisingly, we show that one cannot\n\nconstruct a linear sized external memory point enclosure data\n\nstructure that can be used to answer a query in O(log(B) N + K/B)\n\nI/Os, where B is the disk block size. To obtain this bound, Omega\n\n(N/B1-epsilon) disk blocks are needed for some constant epsilon > 0.\n\nWith linear space, the best obtainable query bound is O(log(2) N +\n\nK/B). To show this we prove a general lower bound on the tradeoff\n\nbetween the size of the data structure and its query cost. We also\n\ndevelop a family of structures with matching space and query bounds.', 1),
(10, 'Text10', 'j', 'We develop an enhanced interval tree data structure that is suitable for the representation of dynamic IP router tables. Several refinements of this enhanced structure are proposed for a variety of IP router tables. For example, the data structure called BOB (binary tree on binary tree) is developed for dynamic router tables in which the rule filters are nonintersecting ranges and in which ties are broken by selecting the highest-priority rule that matches a destination address. Prefix filters are a special case of nonintersecting ranges and the commonly used longest-prefix tie breaker is a special case of the highest-priority tie breaker. When an n-rule router table is represented using BOB, the highest-priority rule that matches a destination address may be found in O(log(2) n) time; a new rule may be inserted and an old one deleted in O(log n) time. For general ranges, the data structure CBOB (compact BOB is proposed). For the case when all rule filters are prefixes, the data structure PBOB (prefix BOB) permits highest-priority matching as well as rule insertion and deletion in O(W) time, where W is the length of the longest prefix, each. When all rule filters are prefixes and longest-prefix matching is to be done, the data structure LMPBOB (longest matching-prefix BOB) permits longest-prefix matching in O(W) time; rule insertion and deletion each take O(log n) time. On practical rule tables, BOB and PBOB perform each of the three dynamic-table operations in O(log n) time and with O(log n) cache misses. The number of cache misses incurred by LMPBOB is also O(log n). Experimental results also are presented.', 1),
(11, 'Text11', 'k', 'We show the first o(n(2)) algorithm for coloring vertices of triangle-free planar graphs using three colors. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n). Our approach can be also used to design O(n polylog n)-time algorithms for two other similar coloring problems. A remarkable ingredient of our algorithm is the data structure processing short path queries introduced recently in [9]. In this paper we show how to adapt it to the fully dynamic environment where edge insertions and deletions are allowed.', 1),
(12, 'Text12', 'l', 'IP address lookup is a critical operation for high bandwidth routers in packet switching networks such as Internet. The lookup is a non-trivial operation since it requires searching for the longest prefix, among those stored in a (large) given table, matching the IP address. Ever increasing routing tables size, traffic volume and links speed demand new and more efficient algorithms. Moreover, the imminent move o IPv6 128-bit addresses will soon require a rethinking of previous technical choices. This article describes a the new data structure for solving the IP table look up problem christened the Adaptive Stratified Tree (AST). The proposed solution is based on casting the problem in geometric terms and on repeated application of efficient local geometric optimization routines. Experiments with this approach have shown that in terms of storage, query time and update time the AST is at a par with state of the art algorithms based on data compression or string manipulations (and often it is better on some of the measured quantities).', 1),
(13, 'Text13', 'a', 'Ranking queries, also known as top-k queries, produce results that are ordered on some computed score. Typically, these queries involve joins, where users are usually interested only in the top-k join results. Top-k queries are dominant in many emerging applications, e.g., multimedia retrieval by content, Web databases, data mining, middlewares, and most information retrieval applications. Current relational query processors do not handle ranking queries efficiently, especially when joins are involved. In this paper, we address supporting top-k join queries in relational query processors. We introduce a new rank-join algorithm that makes use of the individual orders of its inputs to produce join results ordered on a user-specified scoring function. The idea is to rank the join results progressively during the join operation. We introduce two physical query operators based on variants of ripple join that implement the rank-join algorithm. The operators are nonblocking and can be integrated into pipelined execution plans. We also propose an efficient heuristic designed to optimize a top-k join query by choosing the best join order. We address several practical issues and optimization heuristics to integrate the new join operators in practical query processors. We implement the new operators inside a prototype database engine based on PREDATOR. The experimental evaluation of our approach compares recent algorithms for joining ranked inputs and shows superior performance.', 1),
(14, 'Text14', 'c', 'While brain death and the dead donor rule (patients must not be killed by organ retrieval) have been clinically and legally accepted in the US as a prerequisite to organ removal, there is little data about public attitudes and beliefs concerning these matters.\nTo examine the public attitudes and beliefs about the determination of death and its relationship to organ transplantation, 1351 Ohio residents greater than or equal to 18 years were randomly selected and surveyed using random digit dialing (RDD) sample frames. The RDD telephone survey was conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviews. The survey instrument was developed from information provided by 12 focus groups and a pilot study of the questionnaire.\nThree scenarios based on hypothetical patients were presented: brain dead, in a coma, or in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). Respondents'' provided personal assessments of whether the patient in each scenario was dead and their willingness to donate that patient''s organs in these circumstances.\nOver 98% of respondents had heard of the term brain death, but only one-third (33.7%) believed that someone who was brain dead was legally dead. The majority of respondents (86.2%) identified the brain dead patient in the first scenario as dead, 57.2% identified the patient in a coma as dead (Scenario 2), and 34.1% identified the patient in a PVS as dead (Scenario 3). Nearly, a third (33.5%) were willing to donate the organs of patients they classified as alive for at least one scenario, in seeming violation of the dead donor rule.\nMost respondents were not willing to violate the dead donor rule, although a substantial minority was. However, the majority of respondents were unaware, misinformed or held beliefs that were not congruent with current definitions of brain death. This study highlights the need for more public dialogue and education about brain death and organ donation.', 1),
(15, 'Text15', 'e', 'In this paper we will present a language-independent probabilistic model which can automatically generate stemmers. Stemmers can improve the retrieval effectiveness of information retrieval systems, however the designing and the implementation of stemmers requires a laborious amount of effort due to the fact that documents and queries are often written or spoken in several different languages. The probabilistic model proposed in this paper aims at the development of sternmers used for several languages. The proposed model describes the mutual reinforcement relationship between stems and derivations and then provides a probabilistic interpretation. A series of experiments shows that the sternmers generated by the probabilistic model are as effective as the ones based on linguistic knowledge.', 1),
(16, 'Text16', 'g', 'Digital maps can be stored and distributed electronically using compressed raster image formats. We introduce a storage system for the map images that supports compact storage size, decompression of partial image, and smooth transitions between various scales. The main objective of the proposed storage system is to provide map images for real-time applications that use portable devices with low memory and computing resources. Compact storage size is achieved by dividing the maps into binary layers, which are compressed using context-based statistical modeling and arithmetic coding. Partial image decompression is supported by tiling the image into blocks and implementing direct access to the compressed blocks. In this paper, we give overview of the system architecture, describe the compression technique, and discuss implementation aspects. Experimental results are given both in terms of compression ratios and image retrieval timings.', 1),
(17, 'Text17', 'h', 'Spatial relationships between objects are important features for designing a content-based image retrieval system. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, called 9D-SPA representation, for encoding the spatial relations in an image. With this representation, important functions of intelligent image database systems such as visualization, browsing, spatial reasoning, iconic indexing, and similarity retrieval can be easily achieved. The capability of discriminating images based on 9D-SPA representation is much more powerful than any spatial representation method based on Minimum Bounding Rectangles or centroids of objects. The similarity measures using 9D-SPA representation provide a wide range of fuzzy matching capability in similarity retrieval to meet different user''s requirements. Experimental results showed that our system is very effective in terms of recall and precision. In addition, the 9D-SPA representation can be incorporated into a two-level index structure to help reduce the search space of each query processing. The experimental results also demonstrated that, on average, only 0.1254 percent similar to 1.6829 percent of symbolic pictures ( depending on various degrees of similarity) were accessed per query in an image database containing 50,000 symbolic pictures.', 1),
(18, 'Text18', 's', 'There is a world wide concern about traffic-induced soil compaction in crop production. Adjustment of field traffic to the prevailing soil strength conditions is a very promising strategy to prevent soil compaction. The use of low tyre inflation pressure and reduction of the number of wheel passes are practical ways to manage soil compaction. The adoption of such systems by farmers and contractors strongly depends on their technical feasibility and the costs involved in their implementation. Subsoil compaction is very persistent. Nature and mechanization do not offer a sound solution to loosen an unduly compacted subsoil. Therefore, prevention strategies are needed. Very promising mechanization strategies are:(1)on-land-ploughing and (2) use of extra wide tyres at low inflation pressure for all transport and harvesting operations. Limiting tyre inflation pressure also limits wheel load and axle load.', 1),
(19, 'Text19', 't', 'Today, one key to success is the well-timed distribution of information in the production and logistics process, and consistent communication with the company administration. So that all information for all divisions of a company is made available in suitable form, integration in a vertical structure is needed. This form of communication ("vertical integration") is one area of responsibility of logistics. The basis for linking organisation-oriented ERP systems with the "real" world is provided by concepts, services and such products as the HAVERLag(R), a logistics system from HAVER Logistic.', 1),
(20, 'Text20', 'r', 'As neighbouring areas continue to encroach upon wastewater treatment plants, there is an increasing need for odour control to mitigate potential negative off site odorous impacts. One technology that is gaining widespread acceptance is biotechnology, which utilises the inherent ability of certain microorganisms to biodegrade offensive odorous compounds. Two main advantages of this form of treatment over other odour control technologies include the absence of hazardous chemicals and relatively low operation and maintenance requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide information related to odour control design criteria used in sizing/selecting biotechnology-based odour control technologies, and to provide odour removal performance data obtained from several different biotechnology-based odour control systems. CH2M HILL has collected biotechnology-based odour control performance data over the last several years in order to track the continued performance of various biofilters and biotowers over time. Specifically, odour removal performance data have been collected from soil-, organic- and inorganic-media biofilters and inert inorganic media biotowers. Results indicate that biotechnology-based odour control is a viable and consistent technology capable of achieving high removal performance for odour and hydrogen sulphide. It is anticipated that the information presented in this paper will be of interest to anyone involved with odour control technology evaluation/selection or design review.', 1),
